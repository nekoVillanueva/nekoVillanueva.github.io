          <div id="modal-content">
            <p>
                Prior to enrolling at WCCI, Neko spent over five years in a Customer Service/Retail environment before 
                transitioning to work as a Direct Support Profesional. While working as a DSP Neko learned of the various
                assistance options clients with mental and physical disabilities had at their disposal due to advancements in technology.
                This discovery sparked his efforts to continue his education to advance in his life long passion for helping others and 
                being at the forefront of the technological frontier. Neko decided to pursue his career as a software developer in hope 
                of being able to create software and applications that make everyday struggles a lot less stressful.
